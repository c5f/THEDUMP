# THEDUMP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/padmaia/THEDUMP.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/padmaia/THEDUMP)

What is 'the dump' and why am I developing it? It all started with a facebook group my boyfriend started called SAM'S MUSIC DUMP. Sam loves nothing more than finding new music and sharing it with his friends. The problem is there are a million ways to find music these days and a million and one ways to share it.  It's hard to keep track of everything and distribute it to the people who will appreciate it.  We decided that a dedicated facebook group would suit our needs to begin with.  Most everyone has facebook and sharing to a group feels less like spamming acquaintances since people can choose to subscribe or just check in every once in a while.  It doesn't matter if you use soundcloud, or youtube, or whatever, just go on a music binge and dump your links on the dump. Maybe people will dig what you post and share music that they feel has the same vibe, maybe they just give you a thumbs up, or maybe they don't even see it at all.  At the very least you have a timeline of your music tastes that you can dig through later.

If you would like to contribute to this repository or the facebook group, let me know!
